The lion, upon hearing this, became very furious. He asked the rabbit to take him to the new lion’s den so that he could kill the other lion and settle the matter.

The rabbit agreed and led the lion to a deep well.

“He lives in that fortress, My Lord,” said the rabbit to the lion. The lion went to the well and looked inside. He saw his own reflection in the water and thought it was the other lion. He roared in anger. He heard the echo of his voice and thought it was the other lion. He jumped inside the well to kill the enemy lion. But his head crashed against the rocks, he fell into the water and was drowned.

The little rabbit rushed back to tell the other animals how he had saved the forest.
